 17:25:13.00 Having trouble getting a good nights sleep? There may be an
over the counter sleep aid that works well =20

 17:52:38.00 If youre having trouble sleeping, but you dont want to take
medications, there are many products that promise to have the same
effect without the prescription. How safe are they? And do they really
work? Kerry glass man is here with the latest. We have products that are
natural alternatives, correct? Exactly. And most of these are, i will
say, at the beginning, are probably going to be safe. Although if you
are on any medication or even if youre not on medication, i would check
with your doctor. However, its really a matter of, are they going to
work for you? 70 Million americans have trouble sleeping. Lets talk
about some of these. These are the sleeping squares. Theyre similar to
calcium viactiv chews. If youre taking any other medication or in
general, check with your doctor first. They might interact. There is
vitamins and minerals in ther theres also melatonin. Which is the
hormone that helps regulate our sleep. There is .3 Milligrams in there
which is a dose that may help you. Melatonin is safe, its a hormone,
correct? It is safe. There is a small amount in there. There is also an
amino acid found in tea and mushrooms which helps relax you. Is it real
when i going to work? May, may not. If you think somethings going to
help you i do find that to be very effective for many people especially
with sleep. Lets go to the next item. His is a homeopathic remedy, they
are regulated by the fda like an over the counter medication. Theres
small amounts of different plant extracts, minerals in there. So what
they say for homeopathic medicines, it will not interfere with other
medications, but still check with your doctor. I think the placebo
effect works well there too. Probably. This is actually cherry juice,
fresh pressed jerrys. Cherries are the only food that have natural
melatonin in it. There is melatonin in this cherry juice. Some research
has shown it can work just as effective as the melatonin. Can you just
eat cherries? Its not going to be as concentrated. Dream water. Its
similar to those chocolate squares, it has melatonin, 5htp in it. They
dont tell you the amount in here, but the other ones do. Its probably
not enough to do anything. Cherry juice, then. Lets go to aroma therapy.
I love aroma therapy. Its a destressing. Its affecting your olfactory
bulb which can help you release some of those feel good relaxing
hormones. Its not going to harm you. If anything, its going to smell
good. It might put you in a good mood. Give that a try. Thank you so
much. If youre having trouble sleeping, try any of these. Probably this
one is is the one you approve most. Coming up next, the man of steel
gets a super new makeover =20
