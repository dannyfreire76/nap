ith the website (just curiosities). I would looove some samples, I will pur=

ritten email and I am somewhat of a perfectionist :).=20

Hello Alexandra!

Thanks so much for your email!  Unfortunately, we don't have distribution
yet for Sleep Squares.  I'd be happy to send you some more samples but I
don't think they would get to your hotel in time for your show.  I was
also wondering if we could use your great testimonial on our website.  We
would use your first name and state only.  What do you think?  I'd be
happy to send you some more samples as well, just let me know.

Have a great show!
