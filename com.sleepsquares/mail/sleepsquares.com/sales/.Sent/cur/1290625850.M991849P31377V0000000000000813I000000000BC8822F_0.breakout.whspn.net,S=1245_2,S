Dear Elizabeth,

Please be advised that we are in receipt of P.O. # 000138777 for 72 boxes
of Chocolately Sleep Squares.  The order will ship on the requested date
of 11/30/10.  I have read your vendor compliance manual and will adhere to
the required specifications.  As far as affixing labels to each box with
UDFC item number, I have two questions:

Is there a specific size the labels need to be?
Is there a specific area the labels need to be placed?

The best place for our product would be on the bottom of each box. Please
advise if this is okay.

Thank you so much for your business.
