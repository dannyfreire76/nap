Dear Amy,

Sorry for my delay in getting back to you.  We have been traveling. We are
in receipt of the toxicology report. Thank you.  I just had a few more
questions before we proceed with the clinical study.

We have different flavors for the sleep squares.  Should we choose the
original flavor or a raspberry or orange flavor.  I think that difference
in taste may be more noticable with the orignal flavor between the placebo
and the actual square.

Or would the placebo and the actual sleep square need to be the same
flavor or could they be different?

Would we need to have our manufacturer create a placebo and what would
that need to have in it?

Let me know your thoughts,

Nancy
