		The chaos of medical literature that we triage is now organized better to enable you to find what you need faster! 
   <br><br>
         In 1999, we started with a simple idea to save time for busy healthcare professionals like you.  We would read every peer reviewed journal article and categorize each one into a specialty and subspecialty, then send you a personalized briefing of the day as it relates to how you practice medicine.  Every day our physicians sort over 1,000 new articles, read them, rank them, and send over 1,000,000 briefings saving physicians countless hours of time while keeping you more up-to-date on the medical literature.  Reading our exclusive newsletter for 5 minutes a day really is the ONLY way to stay on top of the medical literature. And as you already know - it's free!

		 <span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#1F497D;"><strong>What others are saying:</strong></span>
		<br>
   		 <em>I've used MDLinx for 10 years now and I don't know how anyone could keep up with the medical literature without MDLinx. I'm more up-to-date and better read since they cover all the journals.</em>
		<br><br>
		<em>Staying on top of the medical literature is almost impossible if it were not for MDLinx. Their unbiased sorting and ranking of articles helps me keep up with every medical journal.</em>
		<br><br>
		 <span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#1F497D;"><strong>Editorial Independence</strong> </span>
		<br> 
	  MDLinx uses degreed physicians to read, sort, and rank all the articles. They cover all peer reviewed journals without bias and are not influenced by our advertisers who are clearly labeled as sponsors on our website and newsletters.
