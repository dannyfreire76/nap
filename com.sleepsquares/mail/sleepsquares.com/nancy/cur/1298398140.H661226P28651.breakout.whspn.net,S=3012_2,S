Dear Amy,

Sorry for my delay in getting back to you.  We have been traveling. We are =
in receipt of the toxicology report. Thank you.  I just had a few more ques=
tions before we proceed with the clinical study.

We have different flavors for the sleep squares.  Should we choose the orig=
inal flavor or a raspberry or orange flavor.  I think that difference in ta=
ste may be more noticable with the orignal flavor between the placebo and t=
he actual square.

Or would the placebo and the actual sleep square need to be the same flavor=
 or could they be different?

Would we need to have our manufacturer create a placebo and what would that=
 need to have in it?

Let me know your thoughts,

Nancy
