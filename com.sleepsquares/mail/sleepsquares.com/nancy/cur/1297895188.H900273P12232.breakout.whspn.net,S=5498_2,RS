Thanks Nancy,  it was nice to speak with you as well (and thanks for contac=
ting me). This would be fun and interesting for us to do.

So here's the ugly reality.  To do a study similar to the tart cherries stu=
dy, where we have a target of 15 completers in a crossover design, where ea=
ch participant starts with a one week baseline, one week of "Supplement" A,=
 one week 'washout', and then one week of supplment "b".  We would have thr=
ee study/office visits (1 for intake and informed consent; 1 after the 2 we=
ek mark, and one after the 4 week mark).  Measures would include a host of =
self-report instruments and the ZEO.=20

I see this as a 9 month process from execution of contract (which will itse=
lf take a couple of months becasue of our lega l dept. needing to review it=
).  2 months to finalize protocol and get IRB approval, 6 months to recruit=
 and get folks through the study ad one month for data entry and data analy=
sis.  I would porvidea summary report to you, which you can use for your ow=
n purposes and would simultaneosuly submit as an abstract somehwere as well=
 as a manuscript.  Ubiversity policy is that I could not do interviews or s=
ay anything about the study until the results are presnted somehwere at a s=
cientific meeting or it gets published.=20

Budegt which includes:
- salary support for me, a research coordinator and a medical director (as =
I'm a PhD , we would need an MD on board for a small 5 effort)
- use of Zeos
- advertising for subjects
- payment to subjects=20
- IRB fees
- and the nasty 33% university overhead "indirect rate"

comes in around $35,000.

if we doff the Zeos and just go with self-report we could have only one stu=
dy visit at study initiation and subjects could mail back their self-report=
 forms, this would save ~$5,000.

Might also consider doing a two group design (Sleep Square vs. Placebo) and=
 having something like 12 per group as a target.  This increases sample siz=
e but you would only need two weeks in the study instead of four (and one l=
ess study visit). Costs would be in the same ballpark. If we move forward, =
I might actually try to steer you in that direction.

If this is still in the ballpark for you, there are some design considerati=
ons to go over including:

- age range of subjects (suggest 21 and over)
- what cutoff to use for inclusion on sleep problem (just a sleep complaint=
 or meeting dignositc critieria and/or other benchmark)
- can they be on medications (the common ones being antidepressants, blood =
pressure meds, cholestoerol meds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories)
- can thay have common medical/psych conditions if stable (e.g. arthritis, =
back pain, diabetes, depression, anxiety, etc etc)

The balance is always that the more things you exclude the cleaner the samp=
le, but the harder it is to recruit the uber healthy who's only issue is sl=
eep--(since 80%+ of people with insomnia have a co-morbid condition) .

So there ya go. Happy to discuss more via email or phone.  585-393-7918 is =
the best number to reach me at.=20

best,

Wil =20

Dear Wil,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today concerning a possible clinical
study of our Sleep Squares product.  As we discussed, I am enclosing a
list of our ingredients for your review and can send you the exact amounts
of the herbs in the proprietary blend once a NDA is signed.

If you could give me a quote on a self reporting crossover study with 15
patients as well as a study conducted with the Zeo machine or the other
device you had mentioned I think that would be a good starting point.

Thank you for your time.
