Dear Tamika,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today concerning a possible clinical st=
udy of our Sleep Square product.  I am enclosing a list of our ingredients =
for your review.  Please note that all our natural active ingredients are h=
erbs and vitamins that are readily avaiable in dietary supplement form thor=
oughout the US.  Each of the active ingredients present in the Sleep Square=
s is within the range of approximately 25% - 50% of the most common consume=
r product amount or in some cases below that.
Sleep Squares do not contain any new ingredients.  Upon signing of a non-di=
sclosure agreement, I can provide you with the actual amounts of the herbs =
within our proprietary blend.  Our product is certified OU Kosher Dairy and=
 as such all our ingredients must adhere to the highest quality standards. =
 Our maufacturing facility is FDA compliant and follows all good manufactur=
ing procedures.  Certicate of Analysis is also available upon request.

We would be interested in a doing a clinical study of our product with a gr=
oup of 30 people of three different age groups over a period of several nig=
hts to evaluate their quality of sleep.  Specifically how long it takes the=
m to fall asleep, how long they stay asleep, how many times they wake durin=
g the night and possibly how well rested they feel in the morning. I am als=
o attaching an article on a sleep study that was done on a product called C=
herry Pharm to see if a similar study could be obtained.  Please let me kno=
w if you need more information to proceed.

Thanks for all your help.
