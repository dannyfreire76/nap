Dear Julie,

We want the corner (944) as ordered as our booth set-up is designed  
for that type of layout. If you want to get rid of the booth next to  
us (942), I would be happy to take that as well under Slumberland  
Snacks for an additional $1000. Please let me know so I can plan  
accordingly.

Thanks,
Jeff
