Dear Mom & Jim,

Here is a video clip that can be downloading showcasing Sleep Squares  
on TV. We have purchased it and can now put it up on the website and  
use it for promotion at the upcoming trade show. Go ahead and download  
and save one copy of the video. Try not to download or view prior to  
saving to your personal computer more than once as we have only a  
limited number of views/downloads.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jeff
