Dear Rick,

Go ahead and download and save video to your personal computer. Please  
do not download or view online more than once as we only have limited  
number. Once done, go ahead and upload to our Sleep Squares site. Go  
ahead and make a new button called:

In The News

or something along those lines. Write up a quick blurb outlining what  
it is and let people watch it online.

Let me know if you have any questions or when completed.

Thanks,
Jeff
