Dear Julia,

We have just reserved booth 944 and I wanted to know when we would be =20
able to go in and do our on-line listing and registration. I also will =20
need my username and password to get in as I did not write it down =20
during the booth reservation. The email sent did not have that =20
information listed.

Thanks,
Jeff
