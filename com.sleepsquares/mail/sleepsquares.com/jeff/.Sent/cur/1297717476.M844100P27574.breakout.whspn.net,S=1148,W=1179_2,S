Dear Matthew,

This is Jeff Luciano from UDI & Slumberland Snacks. We meet recently  
at the trade show last week and you expressed interest in our Sleep  
Squares product for the MGM properties' mini bars. My VP of Sales, Ed  
Geopfert, left a message for you earlier and I wanted to follow up  
personally to see how you liked the product. I know you said that you  
were meeting with MGM sometime this week and wanted to make myself  
available to you to answer any questions you may have about bringing  
the product in.

Let me know if you have any questions. I can be reached via email and  
by phone at 888-725-9664 EXT 118.

Thanks,
Jeff Luciano
