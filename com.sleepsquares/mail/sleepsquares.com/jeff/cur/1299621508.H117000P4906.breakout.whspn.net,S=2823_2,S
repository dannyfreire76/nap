Jeff,

Thanks for trying to get in touch.  I have been slammed for the last couple
of weeks.  I showed your product to the MGM are there is not much interest
right now.  If I have customers that might be a good fit, I will be in
touch.

Thanks,

Subject: Trade Show follow up for MGM

Dear Matthew,

This is Jeff Luciano from UDI & Slumberland Snacks. We meet recently at the
trade show last week and you expressed interest in our Sleep Squares product
for the MGM properties' mini bars. My VP of Sales, Ed Geopfert, left a
message for you earlier and I wanted to follow up personally to see how you
liked the product. I know you said that you were meeting with MGM sometime
this week and wanted to make myself available to you to answer any questions
you may have about bringing the product in.

Let me know if you have any questions. I can be reached via email and by
phone at 888-725-9664 EXT 118.

Thanks,
Jeff Luciano
