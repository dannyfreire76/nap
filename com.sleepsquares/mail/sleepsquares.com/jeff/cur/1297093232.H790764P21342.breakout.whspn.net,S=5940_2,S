Dear Julie,

I am able to login to the Exhibitor Section however I cannot find my
company name in pull down list when attempting to register personal
for badges. Can you add Slumberland Snacks to the list or advise other
method to get badges. If it is too late, I can sign up directly at the
show if needed.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Jeff
