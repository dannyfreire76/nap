Hi Sweetheart!!!

We're SOOOOOOOO proud of you!!!  I forwarded the message to Jim and he
put it on his computer.  He's downloading it to a "stick" so that I can
load it onto my work computer and make everyone at work look at it!!!

What's happening with the planning board???

Love,

Mom and Jim

Dear Mom & Jim,

Here is a video clip that can be downloading showcasing Sleep Squares on
TV. We have purchased it and can now put it up on the website and use it
for promotion at the upcoming trade show. Go ahead and download and save
one copy of the video. Try not to download or view prior to saving to
your personal computer more than once as we have only a limited number
of views/downloads.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jeff
