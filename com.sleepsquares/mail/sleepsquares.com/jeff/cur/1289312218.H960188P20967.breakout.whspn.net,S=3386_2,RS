Just one quick question I forgot to ask - was that you in the car at the

Dear Mom,

Glad you liked the video.

We are currently redesigning Goldenrod to better fit what the town =20
wants from a subdivision without compromising too much. We should have =20
some new layouts to share in about a week.

Your son
Jeff
