<br>
The simplest definition of lucid dreaming is being aware that you are dreaming while you are still dreaming.  Like dreams in general, lucid dreaming is most likely to occur during REM sleep, especially toward the end of a night's sleep when the REM sleep is longest.<br>
<br>
Lucid dreaming is a skill that can be learned by anyone who can recall their normal dreams.Anyone interested in lucid dreaming should be willing to be patient while learning the skills that improve their chances of experiencing lucid dreams, including practicing some mental exercises that enhance a dreamer's ability to recognize the dream state.<br>
<br>
According to the studies to date, lucid dreams are not just potentially pleasurable or wish fulfillment experiences, they can be used to improve the quality of the dreamers' waking lives by facilitating healing, peak performance in sports and other activities, problem solving, and by putting an end to recurrent nightmares. Lucid dreaming can help you overcome phobias (spiders, heights, open spaces, etc.), relieve performance anxiety, and build or enhance skills. These types of lucid dreams more closely resemble the dream states described in shamanic and religious traditions.<br>
