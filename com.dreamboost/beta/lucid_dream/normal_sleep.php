<br>
Sleep itself, once presumed to be a period of rest from the activities of the day, has been found to be a time of different activities, in which some parts of the brain are actually more active than during waking hours.  For a healthy adult, a normal night's sleep includes 3 - 6 cycles through the various stages of sleep, each cycle approximately 90 - 120 minutes long, ending with REM sleep.  As the night's sleep progresses, the length of time spent in REM sleep increases from approximately 10 minutes in the first cycle to 30 minutes or sometimes more, in the last cycle.<br>
<br>
Dreaming can occur in any stage of sleep, however when compared with the other stages, dreams during REM sleep tend to be longer, more vivid and visual, and usually not related to current events in the dreamer's life.<br>
